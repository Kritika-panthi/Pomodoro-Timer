# The Process
I made this Pomodoro Timer to practice and improve my front-end JavaScript skills.
First, I created the layout using basic HTML and CSS. Then, I used JavaScript to make the timer work using setInterval().To make it more engaging, I added an animated progress circle using SVG that moves as time counts down. I also added sound alerts when the timer starts or ends, and desktop notifications for better interactivity. Itâ€™s fully responsive and simple to use.
